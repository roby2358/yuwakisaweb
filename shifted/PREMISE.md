# SHIFTED

## A Design Manifesto for a Game About Ordinary People, Extraordinary Power, and Staying Alive Together

---

## Prologue: You Were Nobody

You were on your way to work. Or asleep. Or arguing with your partner about whose turn it was to do the dishes. You were ordinary. Unremarkable. A person with a commute and a phone plan and opinions about coffee.

And then you were somewhere else.

No warning. No explanation. No consent. One moment you were in the world you knew, and the next you were standing barefoot on unfamiliar earth under an unfamiliar sky, wearing whatever you happened to have on, holding nothing, knowing nothing except that everything had changed.

The world you arrived in is dangerous. Not maliciously — indifferently. The way a river is indifferent when it floods, the way winter is indifferent when it kills. The forests are vast and full of things that are larger than you and not afraid of you. The weather does not care that you are unprepared. The nights are cold and long and dark in a way you have never experienced, because you have never been anywhere without electricity.

You will not survive alone.

But you have powers. Something fundamental shifted when you crossed over, and now you can do things that are impossible. Lift boulders with your mind. Heal wounds with a touch. Run faster than anything alive. Disappear.

You don't know why. You don't know how to get back. You don't know if there *is* a way back.

But you're not alone. Others were taken too. Dozens. Hundreds. More arriving all the time. And the first thing people do when they're scared and powerful and stranded — the very first thing — is find each other. Because alone, in this world, you die. Together, you might not.

This is SHIFTED. A game about what ordinary people do when the ordinary world is taken from them and replaced with one that is beautiful, terrifying, and trying to kill them every single day.

## I. The Shift

### What Happened

Nobody knows. That's the first and most important design principle — the game does not explain the displacement at character creation. There is no opening cinematic that reveals the mechanism. There is no wise NPC who delivers exposition. There is only the experience: you were there, now you're here, and you have powers you didn't have before.

The mystery of the shift is the deepest layer of the game. It is not the daily experience — survival and the politics of survival are the daily experience. But it is the background radiation that permeates everything. The world is *slightly wrong* in ways that accumulate over months of play:

- Why does everyone who arrives have powers?
- Why *these* people? Is the selection random, or is there a pattern?
- What are the ancient structures that dot the landscape — clearly not built by the indigenous civilizations, clearly older, clearly *resonant* with the Shifted?
- Why do precognitive visions sometimes show things that have nothing to do with survival — flashes of somewhere else, something vast, something watching?
- Is the shift ongoing? (Yes. New players joining the game are literally new arrivals. The shift has not stopped.)
- Is there a way back?

These questions are answered slowly, over months and years of server time, through exploration, through precog visions, through discoveries at ancient sites, and through community effort. No single player can assemble the full picture. The mystery is a collective project — which means controlling access to its fragments becomes, itself, a resource worth fighting over. Not for power. For understanding. For hope.

### The Social Inversion

The Shifted arrive with nothing except their old-world identities. And those identities are instantly, brutally irrelevant.

The accountant who was invisible in the real world might manifest powers that make them the only person who can protect the camp at night. The CEO who dominated boardrooms is trying to figure out how to not die of exposure. The barista has become a healer and is suddenly the person everyone depends on to stay alive.

Old-world status, wealth, credentials, social networks — all gone. The hierarchies of the world the players left are meaningless here, because here the only hierarchy that matters is the one that keeps people breathing.

This inversion is the emotional engine of the game. Every player carries the ghost of who they were and must reconcile it with who they are becoming. The teacher who becomes the tribe's defender. The quiet introvert who discovers they can read minds and becomes the person who knows when danger is approaching. The surgeon who already knew how to heal and now can do it with a thought — and cannot rest, because someone is always hurt.

Character backstory isn't flavor text. It's the wound the game is built on.

## II. The Powers

### Universal Precognition

Every Shifted person has precognitive ability. This is not optional, not a class feature, not a specialization. It is a fundamental consequence of the shift — whatever process ripped these people from their world and deposited them here also cracked open their relationship with time.

At baseline, precognition is faint: occasional flashes of danger, a gut feeling that something is wrong, a dream that turns out to be more than a dream. Every player begins with basic Sense Danger — a low-tier, one-pillar precognitive capacity that provides murky warnings about immediate threats.

In a world this dangerous, even that baseline is precious. The flash of unease before the predator strikes. The dream about the river that turns out to be a flood warning. The nagging feeling that the northern pass isn't safe today. Precognition isn't a strategic advantage in SHIFTED — it's the margin between life and death.

Players who choose to invest in their precog can refine and strengthen it, ascending through tiers of clarity and range. But even players who never invest a single point in precog will occasionally receive visions. The future presses in on everyone. Some just feel it more clearly than others.

This means the precognitive narrative engine — the server-side timeline that generates real foreknowledge — is not a niche feature for one character type. It is the connective tissue of the entire player experience. Everyone has a relationship with the future. Everyone carries some weight of knowing. The shared experience of partial, undated, fragmentary visions becomes part of the culture of survival.

#### The Five-Pillar Vision

Every precognitive vision describes a future state along five axes — but never all five, and never *when*:

- **Who** is acting? A face, a silhouette, tribal markings, a familiar voice.
- **What do they have?** A weapon, a tool, a stolen artifact, resources.
- **What do they know?** A secret discovered, a plan revealed, a betrayal in motion.
- **Where are they?** A ridge line, a river crossing, a settlement, a ruin.
- **What are they doing?** An action frozen in time. A blade falling. A wall burning. A hand extended in alliance or treachery.

The power tier determines how many pillars are revealed:

- **Tier 1 — Sense Danger** (universal baseline): One pillar, murky. A feeling. A location that feels wrong. A sound in a dream. Enough to make you check the perimeter. Not enough to know why.
- **Tier 2 — Omen**: Two pillars, somewhat clear. Water rising near the east camp. Strangers on the southern ridge. Enough to send scouts, raise alerts, start preparing.
- **Tier 3 — Vision**: Three pillars, vivid. A specific threat, at a specific place, doing a specific thing. Enough to form a plan — if you knew when.
- **Tier 4 — Prophecy** (deep investment required): Four pillars, crystalline. Almost everything. The most dangerous amount of knowledge, because the missing *when* means you see the disaster in perfect detail and still don't know if you have an hour to prepare or a month.

**Five pillars are never revealed.** No power, no combination, no cost will ever tell you when. The universe has a fundamental information limit, and it is temporal. Even at the highest tiers, even at the ancient sites where precognition blazes with unnatural clarity, the future refuses to be dated.

#### Precog in a Dangerous World

In a world that is actively trying to kill you, precognition is not intelligence — it is a survival sense. And it is terrifying.

You see the flood. You see your camp underwater. You see people struggling. You don't know if it's tomorrow or next month. What do you do? Move the camp *now*, spending precious resources and energy on relocation that might not be necessary for weeks? Stay and risk being caught unprepared? Send scouts to monitor the river, pulling them away from hunting and defense?

Every vision is a resource allocation crisis. Because in a dangerous world, preparing for one threat means *not* preparing for another. The DP spent seeking visions is DP not spent on defense. The people sent to scout the river aren't guarding the camp. The food stockpiled for evacuation isn't feeding anyone today.

And in an MMO, the most electrifying application: **precog can detect other players' planned actions.** A rival tribe coordinating a raid generates narrative weight in the server's timeline. Your tribe's precog gets a vision — warriors, a familiar hillside, violence. No timestamp. Is it tomorrow? Next week? A feint?

The precog warns the tribe. Scouts go out. Defenses are prepared. Or — the precog misreads it, the tribe panics, resources are wasted on fortification that should have gone to food gathering, and the real crisis turns out to be the storm that nobody saw coming because everyone was watching the wrong threat.

This is the cruel genius of partial knowledge: it doesn't just reveal dangers, it creates *competition between dangers* for the tribe's finite attention and resources.

#### Burden

Precognition carries weight. Every vision received adds to a character's **Burden** — the psychological cost of carrying undated knowledge of threats to the people you're trying to keep alive.

In SHIFTED, Burden isn't an abstract strategic cost. It's the weight of seeing your friends in danger and not knowing when. It's lying awake at night knowing something terrible is coming and not being able to tell anyone *when to be afraid*. It's the slow erosion of peace that comes from being the person who always sees the worst possibilities.

At low levels of precog investment, Burden is light. The occasional flash of danger sense creates mild unease that fades quickly. But players who invest heavily in precognition — who become their tribe's early warning system — accumulate Burden that is mechanically significant:

- **Signal Degradation** — high Burden makes subsequent visions noisier, harder to interpret, more ambiguous. The mind becomes saturated with unresolved futures.
- **Social Distortion** — high Burden characters become distant, distracted, harder to interact with. Social actions become less effective. The tribe's oracle is drifting away from the people they're trying to protect.
- **Crisis** — if Burden maxes out, visions intrude unbidden. Past and future blur. The character becomes unreliable until Burden is reduced.

Burden reduction:

- **Sharing** — telling someone what you've seen transfers some weight. In a survival context, this is natural — you *should* be warning people. But sharing every vision can cause panic, and false alarms erode trust.
- **Resolution** — when a foreseen event occurs, the associated Burden lifts. Even if the event was terrible, the *not-knowing-when* is over. There is a grim relief in catastrophe finally arriving.
- **The Ancient Sites** — the old structures interact with Burden in unpredictable ways. Some reduce it. Some transform it. Some amplify it.
- **Community** — being among people who trust you, who believe what you've seen, who act on your visions without demanding certainty — this eases the weight. The oracle who is believed suffers less than the oracle who is doubted. Trust is medicine for Burden.

#### The Screaming

When the server's narrative timeline is under strain — when player actions are bending a major planned event away from its default path — every precog in the affected area feels it.

Minor deviations produce unease. Significant deviations produce dissonance — contradictory visions, spiking Burden. Major deviations produce *agony*. The timeline is being rewritten and the rewriting hurts.

And when a major event is successfully averted — when enough people coordinate to break a destiny — the precogs who saw the original future are left carrying visions of something that will never happen. Ghost futures. Burden that can never resolve through occurrence, because the event was unmade.

The price of changing fate is remembering the fate you destroyed.

#### Retrocognition

The shift shattered the normal human relationship with time. Some players develop the ability to see the past as well as the future — and both arrive without timestamps.

A character with retrocognition might touch an ancient structure and receive a vision of people who were there before — but *when* before? A thousand years? Ten? Yesterday?

At higher tiers, past and future visions can become difficult to distinguish. A character might spend days preparing for an attack that already happened. Or dismiss a genuine prophecy as an echo of history.

Near the ancient sites, the distinction collapses entirely. Time is not a line there. It is a field.

### The Chosen Domain

Beyond universal precognition, each Shifted person manifests one major power domain. This is chosen at character creation — whatever the shift does, it amplifies something latent in the individual, and the player determines what that something is.

In a world this dangerous, no domain is about dominance. Every domain is about *keeping people alive* — in different ways, at different costs, with different trade-offs. The domain defines not what you're powerful at, but what kind of survival role you fill for the people who depend on you.

#### Body

Superhuman physical ability. Strength, speed, endurance, resilience, regeneration, sensory enhancement.

**Survival role:** The person who stands between the tribe and the things that would kill them. The one who carries the injured through the blizzard. The one who hunts the megafauna that could feed twenty people for a week. The one who holds the line when the perimeter is breached.

**Specialization spectrum:** The tank — immense strength, near-invulnerability, the tribe's wall. The speedster — blinding quickness, the tribe's first responder. The endurance runner who carries messages across impossible distances. The sensory specialist who hears the predator before anyone else and smells the storm before it arrives. The regenerator who survives what would kill anyone else and gets back up.

**The cost:** Body players are always in demand and always at risk. They're the first ones sent into danger, the last ones to rest, the ones the tribe depends on for every physical crisis. The emotional weight of being everyone's protector is its own kind of Burden.

#### Mind

Telepathy, empathy, mental influence, psychic defense, memory access, emotional manipulation.

**Survival role:** The tribe's eyes and ears beyond the physical horizon. The person who senses hostile intent before the attack comes. The one who maintains communication when the tribe is scattered. The one who holds the group together emotionally when fear and despair threaten cohesion.

**Specialization spectrum:** The telepath who detects approaching threats by sensing minds at range. The empath who manages group morale during the darkest nights. The communicator who maintains telepathic links between scouting parties and the camp. The shielder who protects the tribe's plans from enemy Mind players.

**The cost:** Mind players know too much. They feel the tribe's fear, their despair, their anger. They sense when someone is thinking of leaving. They know who's lying. This knowledge is useful and corrosive. The Mind player's challenge is maintaining their own psychological integrity while swimming in everyone else's emotions.

**Interaction with precog:** Mind players can amplify or clarify precognitive visions — their own or others'. They can also interfere with precognition — shielding planned actions from prophetic detection. Mind and Precog together form the intelligence and counterintelligence axis of tribal warfare.

#### Matter

Telekinesis, elemental manipulation, material shaping, energy projection, structural creation and destruction.

**Survival role:** The person who builds the shelter that survives the storm. The one who shapes stone into walls and wood into structures in hours instead of weeks. The one who controls the fire that keeps everyone warm and the one who can put out the fire that threatens to consume the camp.

**Specialization spectrum:** The telekinetic who moves and assembles building materials at speed — the tribe's construction crew in a single person. The elementalist who controls fire for warmth and defense, or water for irrigation and purification. The shaper who works raw materials into tools, weapons, and structures without needing a forge or a workshop. The destroyer who can bring down an enemy's walls or clear a rockslide blocking the only pass.

**The cost:** Matter players are the most *needed* and therefore the most overworked. There is always something to build, something to repair, something to shape. The tribe's infrastructure depends on them. Rest is a luxury they rarely get, because every hour they spend recovering is an hour the walls aren't being reinforced.

#### Life

Healing, harming, biological manipulation, disease control, agricultural enhancement, poison, growth acceleration.

**Survival role:** The most essential person in the tribe. The one who keeps people alive when they're sick, injured, poisoned, infected. The one who helps crops grow in difficult soil. The one who purifies water and neutralizes toxins. Without a Life player, the tribe's attrition rate from disease and injury alone will slowly destroy it.

**Specialization spectrum:** The healer who mends wounds, cures disease, accelerates recovery — the tribe's most beloved and most burdened member. The grower who enhances crops, nurtures livestock, accelerates plant growth — the person who prevents famine. The purifier who cleanses water and food of contaminants. The harmer — because every healing power has a harmful inverse, and sometimes the tribe needs a weapon that leaves no mark.

**The cost:** The Life player never rests because someone is always hurt. The emotional toll of triage — deciding who gets healing when three people are injured and you only have enough DP for two — is devastating. Life players are the tribe's most valuable member and its most exhausted. They carry a unique Burden: not the weight of knowing the future, but the weight of knowing that their energy is finite and the need for it isn't.

#### Space

Teleportation, phasing, spatial distortion, portals, dimensional awareness.

**Survival role:** The tribe's lifeline to the world beyond the horizon. The person who can scout without risk, escape without being followed, move supplies across distances that would take days on foot, and — when everything falls apart — get people out.

**Specialization spectrum:** The blinker who teleports short distances — the tribe's escape artist, the person who pulls the wounded out of danger in an instant. The traveler who covers vast distances — the only way to maintain contact with distant allies or resources. The phaser who moves through solid matter — the scout who can enter any space and leave any prison. The portal maker who creates passages others can use — the tribe's infrastructure for rapid movement.

**The cost:** Space players are rare and *everyone wants them*. A tribe with a Space player has strategic mobility. A tribe without one is geographically pinned. This makes Space players politically contested — their recruitment is a major event, their defection is a crisis, and their exhaustion from constant demands for "just one more teleport" is chronic. The tribe needs the Space player's DP more than the Space player has DP to give.

**Interaction with precog:** Space players near the ancient sites report that spatial abilities behave differently — distances warp, teleportation destinations shift, phasing reveals glimpses of *other places* that shouldn't be there. The shift that brought everyone here may have a spatial dimension that Space players are uniquely attuned to.

#### Veil

Illusion, invisibility, sensory manipulation, disguise, misdirection, perceptual distortion.

**Survival role:** The tribe's first line of defense that isn't a wall — the person who makes the camp invisible to approaching threats, who creates phantom campfires to misdirect raiders, who scouts enemy positions without being seen, who makes the tribe's twenty warriors look like two hundred.

**Specialization spectrum:** The invisible — true optical invisibility, the perfect scout. The illusionist — phantom threats, illusory defenses, false trails. The disguise artist — approaching indigenous settlements appearing as one of them. The sensory manipulator — blinding and disorienting attackers. The perceptual distorter — making the camp look like empty forest to anyone approaching.

**The cost:** Nobody fully trusts a Veil player. Their fundamental ability is to make things appear other than they are, and that includes themselves. This creates a permanent credibility deficit that Veil players must constantly work against. The tribe needs them — desperately, in a world this dangerous — but trusting the person whose power is deception requires a kind of faith that doesn't come easily to frightened people.

**Interaction with precog:** Veil players can potentially mask their tribe's actions from enemy precogs — hiding planned movements, disguising strategic intentions. This makes Veil the natural counter to the precognitive intelligence network. A tribe with strong Veil capability is harder to foresee. A tribe without it is an open book.

### Power Progression

Powers grow through use, not through a menu. The shift granted the seed of ability — development comes through practice, experimentation, and the desperate improvisation that a dangerous world demands.

**Discovery:** Characters begin with a basic expression of their chosen domain and universal baseline precognition. Additional abilities within the domain are *discovered* through play — attempting things you haven't tried before, pushing boundaries in moments of crisis, necessity unlocking capability. The healer who discovers they can cure poison because someone was *dying of poison and they had to try something*.

**Refinement:** Once discovered, abilities improve through repeated use. The telekinetic who lifts small stones daily can eventually move boulders. The healer who treats minor wounds eventually learns to cure disease. Progression is organic and tied to actual gameplay, not abstract experience points.

**Precog Investment:** Players can choose to invest effort in developing their precognitive abilities. This means training with experienced precogs, spending time at the ancient sites, deliberately seeking and interpreting visions. Precog advancement is available to everyone, and in a world this dangerous, a tribe's precog capability is often the difference between surviving a crisis and being destroyed by it.

**Cross-domain Interaction:** At advanced levels, domains begin to interact with precognition in unique ways. A Mind player with strong precog can sense approaching threats through a combination of telepathic awareness and prophetic intuition. A Life player with developed precog can sense disease before symptoms appear. A Space player with precog can feel spatial distortions before they manifest. These emergent combinations reward deep investment and creative play.

## III. The World

### A World That Wants to Kill You

The world of SHIFTED is beautiful. It is also relentlessly, indifferently lethal.

This is the foundational design principle: **the primary struggle is staying alive.** Everything else — the politics, the powers, the prophecy — exists in service of survival. Tribes don't form for fun. They form because alone, you die. Alliances aren't strategic — they're desperate. Resources aren't hoarded for advantage — they're hoarded because winter is coming and there isn't enough food.

The danger is not gamified annoyance. It is persistent, varied, and genuinely threatening:

**The elements.** Winters are killing cold. Summers bring drought and fire. Storms are violent and unpredictable. Floods reshape the landscape. The weather doesn't scale to player level — a blizzard is just as deadly to a veteran tribe as it is to a new arrival. Powers mitigate the danger but don't eliminate it. The Body player can endure the cold longer but still needs shelter. The Matter player can build a wall against the flood but the river doesn't care about walls.

**The wildlife.** This world's fauna evolved without human predation. The animals are large, unafraid, and some are apex predators that regard humans as food. Megafauna move in herds that can trample a settlement. Predator packs hunt with intelligence. Venomous species lurk in exactly the places you need to go for resources. The wilderness between settlements is genuinely hostile territory.

**Disease and injury.** Without modern medicine, every wound is potentially fatal. Infection is a constant threat. Seasonal diseases sweep through camps. Food spoilage, waterborne pathogens, parasites — the invisible killers that took more lives than warfare throughout human history are all present and active. Life players are essential because without them, attrition from disease alone would slowly destroy every tribe.

**The indigenous.** The people who were here first are not universally hostile — but they are not universally friendly either. The Shifted are, from their perspective, bizarre and threatening interlopers with incomprehensible abilities who are settling on contested land. Some indigenous groups will trade. Some will fight. Some will do both depending on the season and the political situation. And they know this land in ways the Shifted don't — where the floods come, which berries kill you, where not to go after dark.

**Other Shifted.** In a world of scarcity, other tribes of Shifted people are both your best hope and your greatest threat. They might trade the food you need — or take the territory that feeds you. Every encounter with another tribe is a calculation: cooperation or competition? And the answer can change overnight.

**The ancient sites.** The old structures are not directly dangerous — mostly. But they attract attention, amplify powers unpredictably, and seem to be connected to whatever caused the shift. Tribes that control ancient sites gain advantages but also draw the interest of every other faction on the map. And the sites themselves occasionally... do things. Power surges, spatial distortions, temporal anomalies. The sites are not safe. They are *useful*. The distinction matters.

### The Texture of Danger

The world's danger is not constant assault. It is *constant pressure*. The difference matters.

Most days, nobody attacks. Most nights, no predator breaches the perimeter. But the *possibility* is always there, and the preparation for it consumes resources, attention, energy, and time. The tribe needs sentries, which means people not gathering food. The camp needs walls, which means the Matter player isn't building storage. The food needs to be preserved for winter, which means eating less now.

Danger in SHIFTED is primarily a *resource allocation problem*. The world presents a constant stream of threats and needs, and the tribe has finite people, finite DP, finite time, and finite attention to address them. The politics of survival are the politics of triage: **which threat do we prepare for? Which one do we accept? Who decides?**

This is where precognition becomes agonizing. The tribe's precog sees three threats coming: a storm, a predator migration, and a possible raid from a neighboring tribe. None of them have timestamps. The tribe can prepare for *maybe two* of them. Which two? The precog's vision is four-fifths complete and completely useless for prioritization because the one missing piece — when — is the only thing that would tell you which danger to address first.

The tribe debates. The Body players want to prepare for the raid. The Life player is worried about disease that the storm might bring. The Matter player thinks fortifying against the predators is the priority. The Mind player thinks the raid isn't coming for weeks and the storm is imminent but can't explain *how* they know this because it's a feeling, not a fact.

Nobody is wrong. Nobody has enough information. Something has to give. Welcome to tribal politics.

### The Land

The Shifted arrive in a world that is vast, ecologically complex, and designed to make self-sufficiency impossible.

**Scale matters.** The world is large enough that no single tribe can control it, and distant enough in its extremes that geography creates natural boundaries. Tribes on opposite sides of a mountain range may never interact. Tribes sharing a river valley are forced into constant negotiation or conflict — over water, over fishing, over the fertile floodplain that only one of them can farm.

**Resources are regional.** No single territory provides everything a tribe needs to survive:

- Fertile agricultural land is in the lowlands, which flood
- Metal ores are in the hills, which are exposed and hard to defend
- Medicinal plants grow in specific forests, which are predator territory
- Fresh water is abundant near rivers, which are also the natural highways for raiding parties
- The best defensive positions are on high ground that grows nothing
- Wood for building and fuel is in forests that take time to harvest and deplete with use

This distribution makes trade and cooperation *survival necessities*, not optional strategies. A tribe that tries to go it alone will be deficient in something critical. A tribe that trades effectively can cover its weaknesses — but trade creates dependency, and dependency creates vulnerability.

**Seasons are real and they are harsh.** The world has a climate cycle that structures everything:

- **Spring:** Growth, abundance begins, expansion possible. The time to explore, plant, build. But also when disease peaks as dormant pathogens awaken.
- **Summer:** Full abundance, the best time for long-range activity. But heat, drought, and fire are real dangers. Also peak conflict season — tribes have the resources to wage war.
- **Autumn:** Harvest and preparation. The urgency of storing enough to survive winter drives every decision. Tribes that didn't prepare face a reckoning.
- **Winter:** Survival. The killing season. Cold, scarcity, darkness, close quarters, cabin fever. Tribes that prepared well endure. Tribes that didn't face starvation, disease, and collapse. Winter is when political fractures become fatal — there's nowhere to go and not enough of anything.

The seasonal cycle structures the political cycle naturally. Alliances form before winter because nobody wants to face it alone. Wars happen in summer because that's when you can afford to fight. The transitions between seasons are when the most dramatic shifts occur — the desperate alliance in late autumn, the bitter schism during a hard winter, the aggressive expansion in early summer.

### The Indigenous

The Shifted are not the first people here. Indigenous civilizations occupy this world — bronze-age societies with their own cultures, languages, religions, territories, and military capabilities. They have been here for generations. They understand this world in ways the Shifted don't.

The indigenous are not NPCs to be farmed. They are political entities with their own internal dynamics, and their relationship with the Shifted is one of the game's richest dimensions:

- **Knowledge trade** — the indigenous know which berries are poisonous, where the floods come, when the predator migrations happen, which plants cure fever. This knowledge is *survival-critical* and the Shifted don't have it. Trading for indigenous knowledge — or earning it through alliance — can save a tribe.
- **Territorial friction** — the Shifted are settling on land the indigenous use. Even well-intentioned settlement displaces hunting grounds, farming territory, and sacred sites. Conflict is not inevitable but it takes effort to avoid.
- **Power asymmetry** — the Shifted have supernatural abilities. The indigenous don't. This creates a colonial dynamic that the game does not shy away from. How the Shifted treat the indigenous is a moral question with practical consequences — a tribe that brutalizes indigenous neighbors makes enemies. A tribe that trades fairly gains allies who know the land better than they ever will.
- **Mutual threat** — some dangers threaten everyone equally. A harsh winter, a megafauna migration, a disease outbreak. These shared threats can create unlikely alliances — Shifted powers combined with indigenous knowledge of the land.
- **The ancient sites** — the indigenous have their own stories about the old structures. Mythologized, fragmentary, often contradictory — but containing real information for anyone patient enough to listen and cross-reference with precog visions and direct exploration.

### The Ancient Sites

Scattered across the world are structures that predate the indigenous civilizations. Stone formations, underground chambers, geometric patterns carved into bedrock, towers of a material that is not quite stone and not quite metal. They are old. They are *resonant*.

The ancient sites interact with the Shifted in ways that are useful, unsettling, and not fully understood:

- **Precognition** amplifies near the sites. Visions are more vivid, more frequent, more multi-pillared. But also stranger — pushing toward themes that have nothing to do with local survival. Images of the shift itself. Of other worlds. Of something purposeful.
- **Domain powers** behave differently near the sites. Matter players report that the structures resist manipulation. Space players feel spatial distortions. Mind players sense an enormous background presence — or absence. Life players feel the structures are neither alive nor dead but something else entirely.
- **Burden** interacts with the sites unpredictably. Some players report reduction. Others report transformation — the weight doesn't decrease, it *changes character*.
- **Retrocognition** at the sites reveals fragments of deep time — visions of the structures being built, or used, or abandoned, by beings that are not human and not indigenous and not anything recognizable.

The sites are the game's mystery nodes and its most contested territory. A tribe that controls an ancient site gains enhanced precog, amplified powers, and fragments of the truth about the shift. But holding a site means defending it — against other Shifted tribes who want the same advantages, and against the site itself, which occasionally surges with unpredictable energy.

### New Arrivals

The shift is ongoing. New players joining the game are new Shifted — arriving confused, barefoot, powered, and alone in a world that will kill them if nobody helps.

New arrivals create immediate survival dynamics:

- **Rescue operations.** A new arrival alone in the wilderness is in genuine danger. Tribes that maintain scouts watching known arrival zones save lives — and gain grateful new members. Tribes that don't bother lose potential allies to exposure, predators, or rival recruiters.
- **Recruitment urgency.** Every new arrival is a potential tribal member with a domain the tribe might desperately need. A new Life player appearing near your territory when your healer is exhausted? That's not recruitment — that's salvation. But the tribe three hills over wants them too.
- **Information from the old world.** New arrivals come from the world that continues to exist. They carry news, context, and fresh perspectives. For long-established Shifted, new arrivals are a connection to a life they're slowly forgetting.
- **Mystery data.** Each new arrival is another data point. Were they taken from the same time? The same place? Do they remember anything about the transition? Patterns may emerge over months — if anyone is tracking them.

## IV. The Tribes

### Why Tribes Exist

Tribes exist because alone, you die.

This is not a metaphor. A single person in the world of SHIFTED — even one with superhuman abilities — faces threats that no individual can handle indefinitely. You can fight off a predator, but you can't fight while you sleep. You can build a shelter, but you can't build and hunt and gather and keep watch simultaneously. You can heal yourself, but you can't heal yourself if you're unconscious from the injury that needs healing.

Survival requires cooperation. Cooperation requires organization. Organization, among frightened people with extraordinary power, becomes politics.

Tribes in SHIFTED are not preset factions selected from a menu. They are political entities created, governed, fractured, merged, and destroyed by players. The game provides the pressure — the relentless, indifferent danger of the world. The players provide the response.

### Tribal Formation and Governance

**Formation:** Any group of players can declare a tribe. There are no mechanical restrictions on size, composition, or structure. A tribe might be two people in a cave or two hundred people across a network of settlements. The game recognizes tribes as entities for purposes of territory, reputation, and diplomacy — but everything internal is player-determined.

**Governance emerges from necessity.** The game doesn't provide governance templates. Tribes develop their own structures based on their composition, their values, and the crises they face:

- The tribe that formed around a powerful Body player might default to warrior-leadership
- The tribe with several Mind players might develop a council model based on consensus-reading
- The tribe whose Life player is the only thing keeping everyone alive might evolve into something like a medical theocracy — the healer's word is law because the healer's continued willingness to serve is non-negotiable
- The tribe that survives a terrible winter through collective sacrifice might develop fiercely egalitarian norms

These structures are not permanent. They are tested, stressed, and remade by every crisis. The democratic tribe that faces a sudden raid might need a war-leader. The autocratic tribe whose leader makes a catastrophic decision might revolt. Governance is not a setting — it is an ongoing negotiation between people who need each other to survive.

### Composition Pressure

The domain system creates natural pressure for diverse tribal composition, because *survival requires capabilities that no single domain provides*:

- A tribe of all Body players can fight but can't heal. Every battle creates attrition they can't recover from. One bad infection could spiral.
- A tribe with no Life player faces slow death from accumulated injury, disease, and famine. This is the most critical gap.
- A tribe with no Mind player can't detect approaching threats at range, can't sense hostile intentions, can't maintain communication between scattered groups.
- A tribe without Matter players builds slowly and poorly. Their shelters leak. Their walls crumble. They can't work metal or shape stone.
- A tribe without Space players is geographically pinned. No rapid scouting, no quick resupply, no evacuation route.
- A tribe without Veil players is visible to every precog, every scout, every enemy. Their camp is findable. Their plans are readable.

This creates **recruitment as survival strategy**. A tribe that needs a healer isn't playing politics when they court a new Life player — they're trying not to die. A tribe that loses its only Space player to defection hasn't lost a piece on a game board — they've lost their ability to escape if the camp is overrun.

The most dramatic political moments in SHIFTED aren't wars. They're the day the healer says "I'm leaving."

### The Economy of Scarcity

Resources drive politics because resources determine who lives.

**Basic resources:**
- **Food** — gathered, hunted, farmed. Seasonal availability. Spoilage is real. A tribe that enters winter without sufficient preserved food faces starvation.
- **Water** — not universally accessible. Purification matters. Contaminated water kills slowly and invisibly.
- **Materials** — stone, wood, fiber, clay, metal ore. Regionally distributed. Everything the tribe builds requires materials that might not be local.
- **Medicine** — specific plants, minerals, and biological resources for healing and disease prevention. Life players reduce but don't eliminate the need.
- **Territory** — defensible positions, fertile ground, water access, resource proximity. The most contested resource because it encompasses all others.

**Power-enhanced resources:**
- **Shaped goods** — Matter players create refined materials that are superior to hand-crafted equivalents. These become the tribe's best trade goods.
- **Enhanced agriculture** — Life players accelerate crop growth and improve yields, the difference between subsistence and surplus.
- **Intelligence** — information about threats, opportunities, and other tribes' intentions. Generated by Mind and Precog players. In a dangerous world, knowing what's coming is the most valuable resource.
- **Mobility** — the ability to move people and goods quickly. Provided by Space players. The difference between a tribe that can respond to a distant crisis and one that can't.

**The scarcity must be real.** Not annoying-game-mechanic scarcity where you wait for a timer. Real scarcity where the tribe debates hard choices every day. There isn't enough food for full rations this week. There aren't enough materials to build shelter *and* defenses before the storm. The Life player can heal three people today and five are hurt.

These aren't puzzles to be optimized. They're dilemmas to be *argued about*. And that argument — passionate, desperate, sometimes bitter — is where the politics live.

### Tribal Warfare

In a world of scarcity and danger, conflict between tribes is sometimes unavoidable. But warfare in SHIFTED is not the fun part of the game — it is the *expensive* part. Fighting costs resources, costs DP, costs injuries that the Life player has to heal, costs time not spent on the threats the world is already throwing at you.

This means warfare is a strategic decision with real costs, not a recreational activity. Tribes fight when they believe the cost of *not* fighting is higher — when resources are critical, when territory is essential, when a rival tribe poses an existential threat.

**Raiding:** Quick, targeted strikes on enemy resources. The most common form of conflict because it's the cheapest. Steal food, disrupt infrastructure, test defenses. Deniable if the political situation requires it.

**Siege:** Sustained assault on a fortified position. Extremely expensive. Rarely undertaken except in desperation or overwhelming advantage. The tactical grid expands for major engagements.

**Covert operations:** Mind and Veil players conducting espionage, sabotage, and subversion. The shadow war that can weaken a rival without the cost of open conflict.

**Precog warfare:** The intelligence dimension. Precogs trying to foresee enemy raids. Veil players trying to mask them. Mind players trying to feed false visions. Counter-precog doctrine evolving through player innovation.

**Formal duels:** Disputes between individuals resolved on the tactical grid. Some tribes develop dueling cultures where leadership challenges, resource disputes, and inter-tribal disagreements can be settled without full warfare. This is cheaper than battle — but the stakes for the individuals involved are high.

### The Cost of Dying

Death in SHIFTED is not permanent. But it is *expensive* — not for the person who dies, but for the tribe that keeps them alive.

When a character falls in combat, to a predator, to the elements, or to disease, they enter a critical state. Without intervention from a Life player within a window of time, the character is lost — not permanently, but at enormous cost:

- **The Life player pays.** Bringing someone back from the edge burns through DP reserves that the tribe needs for everything else. The healer who saves the warrior can't heal the sick child tonight.
- **Recovery is slow.** A character who nearly died is weakened for real-time days. Reduced DP capacity, limited power access, physical vulnerability. They are a *liability* to the tribe during recovery — a mouth to feed who can't contribute.
- **The tribe carries the weight.** Every near-death taxes the tribe's most precious resource: the Life player's energy and attention. A tribe that takes casualties frequently burns through its healer, and a burned-out healer means the next crisis has no safety net.

Death isn't game over. It's becoming a burden on the people who need you. It's watching the healer's exhausted face as they spend DP they can't afford on pulling you back. It's knowing that your recklessness or bad luck cost the tribe something it might not be able to replace.

This creates powerful social dynamics. Risk-taking has communal consequences. The Body player who charges into danger recklessly isn't just risking their own life — they're risking the tribe's healing reserves. The tribe has a *legitimate political interest* in how much danger individual members take on. "You don't get to be a hero. We can't afford to save you again."

But the world is dangerous, and sometimes people die despite doing everything right. The storm was too strong. The predator was too fast. The raiders had a Veil player and nobody saw them coming. In those moments, the tribe rallying to save one of their own — the healer pushing past exhaustion, the Body player carrying the fallen to safety, the Mind player keeping the injured conscious through telepathic contact — those are the moments that define what a tribe is.

Staying alive together. That's the game.

## V. The Engine

### The Narrative Timeline

The server maintains a living narrative — a planned sequence of events stretching weeks, months, and years into real-world time. This is the engine that makes precognition real and gives the dangerous world its rhythm.

**Global events:** Seasonal shifts, climate extremes, megafauna migrations, new waves of Shifted arrivals, activations or changes at ancient sites. These are the world-level dangers and opportunities that affect everyone. They are *not scaled to player power* — a brutal winter is a brutal winter whether you've been playing for a day or a year.

**Regional events:** Resource discoveries, natural disasters, indigenous political shifts, predator territory changes, disease outbreaks. These affect specific areas and create localized crises that tribes must respond to — often with insufficient time, information, and resources.

**Tribal events:** Consequences of player actions feeding back into the timeline. A tribe that overhunts a territory triggers prey scarcity. A tribe that angers an indigenous nation faces retaliation. A tribe that occupies an ancient site triggers interest from distant factions. Player choices have narrative consequences that the timeline tracks and develops.

**Mystery events:** Revelations about the shift, changes at the ancient sites, visions that don't fit any pattern, the slow accumulation of clues about *why*. These unfold on the longest timescale and reward patient, community-wide effort. They are the background signal beneath the noise of daily survival.

### The Action Point Economy

SHIFTED uses a dual-resource system designed for the rhythm of daily life — checking in throughout the day, making decisions, returning to see consequences.

**Social Points (SP)** — your capacity for interaction, diplomacy, trade, governance, and coordination. Refills at approximately one point every two to three hours. Cap of eight to ten.

SP is the social game. Managing tribal affairs, negotiating with neighbors, coordinating defense, attending to the human dimension of keeping a group of frightened people functioning as a unit. SP refills faster because the social layer should always be accessible. There is always something to discuss, someone to help, a decision to weigh in on. The human side of survival never stops.

**Dynamic Points (DP)** — your capacity for power use, training, precog development, and extraordinary action. Refills at approximately one point every four to six hours. Cap of five to six.

DP is the power game. Every power use — healing a wound, lifting a boulder, sending a telepathic message, seeking a vision — costs DP. And DP is *scarce*. The Life player with five DP and seven injured tribe members faces an impossible choice. The precog who spent their DP seeking visions has nothing left when the actual danger arrives.

This scarcity is not punitive. It is the *engine of meaningful choice*. Every DP expenditure is a decision with real consequences and real opportunity costs. The game's depth lives in the gap between what you *could* do and what you *can afford* to do.

**Combo actions** — the most impactful moves cost both SP and DP. Negotiating a trade agreement while telepathically reading the other party's real intentions. Leading a tribal council while precognitively scanning for the best course of action. Organizing a hunt while using Body-enhanced senses to track prey. These combined actions represent the moments where social skill and supernatural ability work together — the most powerful plays available, and the most expensive.

**The daily rhythm:**

- Morning: Points near full. The big decisions — major power uses, strategic social moves, crisis response.
- Midday: SP has partially regenerated. Social maintenance, governance, routine coordination.
- Afternoon: DP may have regenerated a point. A targeted power use, a training session, a scouting run.
- Evening: Consequences visible. New information, changed conditions, updated visions. Planning tomorrow.
- Night: For those with precog investment, dreams. Visions arrive during offline hours. You return to find fragments of the future waiting — urgent, undated, demanding response.

### The Tactical Grid

Combat resolves on a tactical grid — the roguelike heart of the game. Turn-based, spatial, consequential.

**Terrain matters.** Hills, rivers, trees, structures, walls. A Matter player can reshape the battlefield mid-fight. A Space player can teleport past chokepoints. A Veil player can fill the field with phantom threats. A Body player can simply crash through obstacles. The grid is physical space, and every domain interacts with it differently.

**Power shapes:**
- **Self** — your tile only (Body enhancements, self-healing)
- **Target** — line of sight to a specific tile (telepathic attacks, ranged strikes)
- **Beam** — straight line from you (telekinetic force, energy projection)
- **Cone** — expanding triangle (sensory disruption, wind blast, area intimidation)
- **Burst** — radius around a point (healing pulse, illusion field, explosion)
- **Aura** — radius around you, mobile (defensive field, sensory enhancement, emotional influence)

Six templates. Every power fits one. Tactical depth without mechanical sprawl.

**Every fight costs something.** Injuries persist. DP is spent. The healer's reserves are taxed. Even a victory has a price, and the tribe feels that price in the days that follow. This means combat is entered deliberately, not casually — because the world doesn't stop being dangerous while you're recovering from a fight.

### Player Actions and the Timeline

When players make significant choices — fortifying a position, launching a raid, occupying an ancient site, forging an alliance — these actions feed back into the narrative engine. The timeline adjusts.

Small adjustments happen constantly and silently. The world adapts.

Major adjustments generate temporal strain. Precogs feel it as the Screaming — visions that fracture, contradict, blur. The intensity scales with the deviation.

**Attractors** — some events are high-inertia nodes that resist change. The harsh winter is coming regardless of what anyone does. The megafauna migration will happen. The ancient site will activate. These can be *survived* with preparation but not *prevented*.

Other events — raids, political shifts, tribal conflicts — are more mutable. Player action can genuinely change them. But changing a foreseen event doesn't make the underlying pressure disappear. Prevent the raid and the rival tribe's resource shortage (which motivated the raid) still exists. The threat transforms rather than vanishes.

The deepest question: are some events truly fated? Can enough coordinated effort break an attractor? And if you do — what fills the void where destiny used to be?

## VI. The Questions

### What SHIFTED Asks

**What do ordinary people do when the world tries to kill them?** Not heroes. Not adventurers. Ordinary people with extraordinary powers and no preparation. The game watches what happens when the barista and the accountant and the teacher have to build a civilization from nothing while everything around them is trying to end them.

**What is the politics of survival?** When every decision is life or death, who decides? How? By what authority? The tribe needs leadership but nobody was elected, nobody was trained, and everybody has superpowers. Governance under existential pressure — the most honest political simulation possible.

**What does it mean to know the future in a world that's trying to kill you?** Precognition as survival sense. The flash of warning that saves your life. The vision of disaster that you can't date and can't ignore. The weight of carrying knowledge that is simultaneously invaluable and incomplete. The agonizing competition between threats for your tribe's finite attention.

**Can people stay good when staying alive is hard enough?** The Life player who could save the enemy's wounded but the tribe needs healing too. The tribe that could share food with starving strangers but might not have enough for their own winter. The Veil player asked to deceive an indigenous group for the tribe's advantage. Morality under pressure. The game doesn't judge. The game watches.

**Why are we here?** The deepest question. The one the game answers most slowly. The one that gives meaning to everything else — the survival, the politics, the power, the prophecy. The answer is in the ancient sites, in the deep visions, in the patterns of the shift itself. And when it comes — if it comes — it changes what every other question means.

## Epilogue: The Arrival

You were nobody. You had a name and a life and a routine and none of it prepared you for this.

You are standing on unfamiliar ground. The air is too clean. The sky is too big. Something large is moving in the tree line and it hasn't decided yet whether you're a threat or food.

You are wearing whatever you had on when it happened. You are holding nothing. Somewhere nearby, you can hear water, which means you won't die of thirst today. That's as far ahead as you can plan.

Except — there's something else. A flicker at the edge of your mind, like remembering a thing that hasn't happened yet. A flash: a campfire, faces you don't recognize, warmth, safety. Another flash: the tree line again, closer, the shape resolving into something with teeth.

Neither vision has a timestamp.

You don't know when the warmth comes. You don't know when the teeth arrive. You only know that both are real, both are coming, and you are standing between them with bare feet and impossible power and no idea what to do next.

But somewhere nearby, someone else is standing in the same dirt, just as scared, just as powerful, just as lost. And if you find each other — if you *choose* each other — you might survive long enough to figure out why you're here.

Welcome to SHIFTED.

You were nobody. Together, you might be enough.
