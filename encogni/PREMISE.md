# WHEN?

## A Design Manifesto for a Game About Knowledge, Suffering, and the Shape of Destiny

---

## Prologue: The Missing Pillar

There are five pillars of certainty. Five axes along which any state of affairs can be known:

- **What you know**
- **What you have**
- **Who you are**
- **Where you are**
- **What you can do**

Five pillars describe the present completely. They describe the past, if anyone cares to look. And they describe the future — almost.

Because the future has a sixth quality that can never be pinned down. Not by any power, not at any cost, not by any combination of minds working in concert. The future refuses to say *when*.

This is a game about that refusal. About the space between knowing and acting, between seeing and preventing, between the photograph and the date stamp that was never printed on its back.

This is a game about precognition in a world where precognition is real, where the future can be seen but never scheduled, where prophecy is both the most powerful gift and the most elegant trap the universe ever designed.

This is a game called **WHEN**.

## I. What You Know

### The Vision

Imagine a galactic civilization sprawling across dozens of worlds. Courtly, stratified, ornate — the politics of Versailles projected onto the 24th century. Noble houses jockey for influence. Military commissions carry social weight. Diplomatic salons buzz with intrigue. Duels of honor are fought in gilded halls.

Beneath this glittering surface, a secret war. Some percentage of the population possesses psionic abilities — telepathy, empathy, telekinesis, precognition, and stranger gifts besides. On some worlds, these abilities are feared and hunted. On others, they are tolerated, exploited, or worshipped. On a few, they are an open secret that everyone pretends not to see.

The player is a psi. Possibly closeted, possibly known, possibly somewhere in between. They navigate the social machinery of the Imperium — climbing, scheming, serving, surviving — while managing the secret of what they are and what they can do. Every psi power is a tool and a liability. Every use is a disclosure. Every disclosure is a risk.

This is not a game about combat. It is a game about *information* — who has it, who wants it, what it costs to get it, and what it costs to keep it.

### The Premise

Two classic tabletop RPGs provide the ancestral DNA:

**Psi World** (Fantasy Games Unlimited, 1984) established the premise: a near-future society where psionic individuals navigate a world that fears them. The question it posed — are you oppressed or celebrated for your gifts? — remains the central tension. But Psi World never had a structural answer for *why* you wouldn't simply use your powers to dominate every situation.

**En Garde!** (Game Designers' Workshop, 1975) provided that structure: a social climbing game set in 17th-century Paris, where reputation, regiment, club membership, patronage, and dueling skill determine your trajectory through society. It understood that *social position* is a resource as real as hit points, and that the most interesting decisions are about status, not combat.

WHEN fuses these two ideas. The social architecture of En Garde gives psionic characters a *reason* to be subtle. The psionic layer of Psi World gives the social game *depth and danger*. Each one solves the other's central design problem.

### The Philosophy

At its core, WHEN explores a single question: **what is the relationship between knowledge and suffering?**

A precog sees the future. The vision is rich and true and *real*. But it arrives compressed — a fragment, a feeling, a flash of imagery ripped from context. The gap between what the precog *experiences* internally and what they can *express* or *act upon* is a kind of suffering. They know, but they cannot fully convey. They see, but they cannot fully act.

This is not an accident of game design. It is the point. Every prophetic tradition in human history understands this: the oracle's curse is not ignorance but *partial knowledge*. Cassandra's tragedy is not that she cannot see — it is that she cannot make others see what she sees, and cannot know exactly when the fall will come.

WHEN is a game about that gap. About carrying knowledge that is simultaneously invaluable and incomplete. About the weight of visions that refuse to tell you the one thing you need most.

## II. What You Have

### The Systems

#### The Energy Economy

WHEN is a browser game designed around the rhythm of daily life. Players check in throughout the day, make decisions, and return later to see the consequences. Two resource pools govern what a player can do:

**Social Points (SP)** represent your public-facing energy — your capacity to show up, perform, network, and navigate the social world. SP refills relatively quickly (one point every two to three hours) and caps at eight to ten points. You can always *do something* in the social world. Attending events, making connections, managing your reputation — the machinery of courtly life is always available.

**Cognitive Points (CP)** represent your mental and psionic energy — your capacity to use powers, train, scheme, and duel. CP refills slowly (one point every four to six hours) and caps at five or six. Psi powers are *precious*. Every use is a deliberate strategic choice, not a casual action.

This asymmetry is deliberate. The social game is always running. The psi game is rationed. A player always has reasons to engage with the world, but their secret capabilities are scarce resources that must be deployed with care.

**Combo Actions** — the most powerful moves in the game cost *both* SP and CP. Attending a diplomatic reception while empathically reading every person in the room. Hosting a salon while telepathically probing a suspected traitor. These combined actions are where the game's deepest strategic play lives, because they drain both pools simultaneously and force the player to weigh social opportunity against psionic expenditure.

#### The Five-Pillar Character Model

Every character in WHEN exists along five axes, derived from the five pillars of security:

**What You Know** — your secrets, your intelligence, your visions, your accumulated information about other characters and factions. Knowledge is a resource that can be stolen (telepathy), falsified (memory manipulation), or weaponized (blackmail, prophecy). The game tracks not only what you know, but what various factions know *about* you — your dossier, your threat profile, your file in the Inquisition's archives.

**What You Have** — your social capital. Military rank, house standing, club memberships, political appointments, faction reputation, accumulated favors and debts. This is the En Garde layer — the visible scoreboard of your position in society. Attacked through political maneuvering, scandal, and social combat. Defended through alliances, reputation, and careful play.

**Who You Are** — your identity, and the distance between your public persona and your true self. In a world of telepaths and shapeshifters, identity is fundamentally contested. Your cover story, your real background, your psi nature, your loyalties — these are layers that can be peeled back, falsified, or shattered. The game tracks multiple identity layers per character, and different factions may know you as different people.

**Where You Are** — your physical and political location. Which world you're posted to, which events you attend, which spaces you occupy. Location determines context — the same action carries different weight and different risk on different worlds. Location can be spoofed (teleportation, astral projection, remote viewing) and surveilled (psi detection, tracking, monitoring networks).

**What You Can Do** — your capabilities, and specifically your psi profile. This is the most dangerous knowledge about any character, because it is the axis most likely to get you conscripted, hunted, or killed. Every psi action partially discloses your capability set. The game tracks what is *known* about your powers versus what you actually possess. A character whose full capability profile is exposed is strategically naked.

#### Character Creation

Character creation is framed explicitly around the five pillars. You don't just pick stats and powers — you define your security posture:

- What do you know? Starting information, connections, secrets you hold
- What do you have? Starting position, commission, house affiliation, resources
- Who are you? Background, cover identity, true identity, the gap between them
- Where are you? Starting world, posting, jurisdiction, social context
- What can you do? Psi disciplines (one major and one minor, or two majors), skills, training

The choices are interconnected. A high starting position (what you have) means more scrutiny on who you are. A powerful psi discipline (what you can do) means greater need to control what others know about you. A prestigious posting (where you are) means more opportunity and more surveillance.

#### The Psi Disciplines

Characters possess psionic abilities organized into discipline trees:

**Core Disciplines (Major)**

- **Precog** — the information tree. Clairvoyance, danger sense, augury, prophecy. The strategic discipline. Provides intelligence but accumulates Burden.
- **Telepath** — the espionage tree. Mind reading, suggestion, mental attack, memory manipulation. The most dangerous and most versatile social tool.
- **Empath** — the intelligence tree. Emotion detection, manipulation, projection, shielding. The subtlest discipline, hardest to detect, invaluable in social settings.
- **Telekinetic** — the force tree. Object manipulation, shielding, flight, elemental control. The most overtly powerful discipline and therefore the hardest to hide.
- **Teleport** — the mobility tree. Personal teleportation, object summoning, dimensional travel. Breaks location-based security assumptions.
- **Self-Aware** — the infiltrator tree. Attribute enhancement, appearance alteration, physical adaptation. The spy's discipline.
- **Healer** — the dual-natured tree. Every healing power has a harmful inverse. Cure disease / cause disease. Heal wound / inflict wound. The most morally complex discipline.
- **Sociokinetic** — the crowd tree. Mass suggestion, emotional contagion, crowd manipulation, group telepathy. Operates at social scale rather than individual scale. Immensely powerful, impossible to use subtly.
- **Chronokinetic** — the forbidden tree. Time manipulation, temporal displacement, age control. The rarest and most reality-distorting discipline. Deeply regulated on every world.

**Elemental Disciplines (Major)**

- **Electrokinetic** — electrical generation, absorption, EMP, bio-electric manipulation
- **Hydrokinetic** — water manipulation, pressure control, purification, tidal forces
- **Geokinetic** — earth manipulation, seismic control, mineral manipulation, terrain shaping
- **Aerokinetic** — wind manipulation, atmospheric control, pressure, sound

**Minor Disciplines** — narrower, more specialized abilities: pyrokinesis, cryokinesis, astral projection, technopathy, null psi, force fields, psi amplification, reality warping, and others.

Characters choose one major and one minor discipline, or two major disciplines. This choice defines their strategic identity and their vulnerability profile.

Within each discipline, powers are tiered:

- **Basic** — low CP cost, available at start, relatively safe to use
- **Advanced** — moderate cost, unlocked through repeated use of basic powers
- **Master** — high cost, late unlock, powerful but risky and conspicuous

#### The Duel

Formal dueling is a social institution across most worlds of the Imperium. Public duels are fought for honor, advancement, and resolution of disputes. But beneath the public tradition exists the *psi duel* — a private, often illegal confrontation between two psionic individuals.

Duels resolve on a tactical grid — a compact, turn-based encounter where characters spend CP to deploy powers spatially. This is the roguelike heart of the game: a small-scale tactical puzzle embedded within the larger social simulation. Mental Attack versus Mind Shield. Telekinetic Blast versus Force Field. Blink repositioning versus area denial.

Duels can be formal (witnessed, regulated, limited in scope) or informal (back alley, no rules, potentially lethal). The social consequences of each are dramatically different. Winning a formal duel earns prestige. Winning an informal duel earns fear — or a murder investigation.

#### The Authentication Mechanic

In a world where identity, location, and capability can all be falsified by psionic means, institutions develop verification protocols. Checkpoints, security screenings, loyalty tests — moments where a faction demands proof along one or more pillars.

A routine checkpoint: prove who you are and where you're authorized to be. Two-factor. Manageable.

A high-security clearance: prove who you are, verify your psi status, confirm your knowledge credentials, validate your location authorization. Four-factor. Requires preparation, specific powers, and careful resource management to subvert.

The Emperor's inner sanctum: five-factor authentication. Nearly impossible to fake. Nearly.

These authentication challenges are where the heist scenarios live. A team of psionic operatives, each contributing their discipline to defeat a different factor. The Telepath handles identity verification. The Self-Aware suppresses the psi scan. The precog mapped the security rotation in advance. The teleporter provides the exit. Everyone spends their CP, everyone takes a risk, and if any single factor fails, everything unravels.

## III. Who You Are

### The Characters

#### The Social Game

The daily rhythm of WHEN is the social game. Players allocate their SP to activities:

- **Attend** an event — galas, salons, military reviews, diplomatic receptions. Each offers different social opportunities and different risks of exposure.
- **Serve** in your official capacity — military duty, administrative work, house obligations. Earns income, builds rank, fulfills expectations.
- **Socialize** at clubs and lodges — build connections, hear gossip, establish alliances. Different clubs serve different factions and social strata.
- **Host** a gathering — expensive in SP but builds reputation rapidly and puts you at the center of a social web.
- **Scheme** — covert actions using psi powers for advantage. Costs both SP and CP.
- **Duel** — challenge or accept a challenge. Costs CP, resolved on the tactical grid. Social consequences vary.
- **Lay Low** — reduce your Psi Reputation. Sacrifice social opportunity for safety.
- **Train** — improve a psi discipline. Costs CP, no social benefit, but builds long-term capability.

The game is in what you choose and what you sacrifice. Every action slot spent on training is a party you didn't attend. Every scheme is CP you won't have for a duel. Every event is a room full of people who might detect what you are.

#### The Reputation Tracks

Three intertwined reputation systems track a character's position:

**Public Standing** — your visible social rank. Military commission, house position, political appointments, social club tier. This is the number everyone can see. It opens doors, grants privileges, and makes you a target.

**Psi Reputation** — how widely known your psionic nature is. This is the critical tension. Low Psi Reputation means safety and anonymity but inability to leverage your powers openly. High Psi Reputation means influence and fear but also attention from the Inquisition, rival psionics, and faction recruiters. The relationship between Public Standing and Psi Reputation *is the game*.

**Faction Standing** — your relationship with the major power structures. Government, military, noble houses, the underground, the Inquisition, merchant guilds, and others. Faction standing determines what opportunities are available to you and who considers you a friend or a threat.

#### Identity and Masks

Every character has layers:

- **Public Identity** — what you present to the world. Name, rank, affiliation. Verifiable through official channels.
- **True Identity** — who you actually are. Background, real loyalties, psi nature. May differ significantly from the public version.
- **Perceived Identity** — what other characters and factions *believe* about you, which may differ from both your public and true identities. Shaped by intelligence, gossip, psi probes, and deliberate misinformation.

The game tracks all three layers. A Telepath who probes you might update their faction's Perceived Identity of you. A Self-Aware shapeshifter might maintain two entirely separate Public Identities on different worlds. A deep-cover operative might have a True Identity that even they have been made to forget (Memory Erasure, with a trigger for restoration).

The most dangerous moment in the game is when any two layers collapse into alignment — when someone's Perceived Identity of you matches your True Identity. When they *know what you really are*.

## IV. Where You Are

### The Worlds

The Imperium spans dozens of worlds, each with its own culture, security posture, and relationship to psionics. The core game mechanics — SP, CP, five pillars, faction standings — remain constant everywhere. What changes is the *context*. The same action carries different weight, different risk, and different meaning depending on where you are.

This is the game's primary content architecture. Each world is a *genre* built on the same mechanical skeleton. New worlds can be added over time, each one shifting the tone and strategic landscape without requiring new systems.

#### The Court of Mirrors

The heart of the Imperium. High society at its most refined and treacherous. Every social interaction is layered with subtext. Duels are formal and regulated. The Inquisition maintains a visible but diplomatic presence. Psi powers are an open secret among the elite — everyone suspects everyone, no one acknowledges anything directly.

*Tone: political thriller. Think Dune's imperial court.*

SP is king here. Social maneuvering is the primary mode of play. CP expenditure is risky because the density of psi-aware individuals means any use might be detected. The game is reading the room, building alliances, and positioning yourself for the next shift in power — all while maintaining your cover.

#### The Flourish

A world where wit, art, and spectacle have become the dominant cultural values. Social status is determined by cleverness, creativity, and sheer entertainment value. Duels are theatrical. Scandals are performance art. The worst thing that can happen to you is being *boring*.

*Tone: comedy of manners. Think Wilde by way of Iain Banks.*

SP flows freely. Social energy is abundant because every interaction is play. Empath powers are practically a social skill here — reading the room is just good manners. Psi Reputation matters less because the culture is tolerant, even fascinated. But beneath the frivolity, real power games are being played, and the lightness of the setting makes betrayal sting more.

#### The Vigil

A theocratic surveillance state where a robed order of psi-adepts monitors the populace. Psionic ability is not illegal — it is *conscripted*. Every identified psi is absorbed into the order or eliminated. The streets are quiet. The architecture is austere. Every public space is monitored empathically.

*Tone: dystopian horror. Think 1984 meets the Bene Gesserit.*

CP is everything. You need your mental shields up at all times. SP barely matters because social life is regimented and monitored. The Inquisition isn't a background threat — it is the government. Authentication challenges are frequent and high-factor. The most valuable skill is *not being noticed*.

#### The Frontier

A military outpost on the edge of settled space. Formally under Imperial authority, practically a law unto itself. Psi powers are unofficially tolerated because survival matters more than doctrine. Duels are common, brutal, and rarely formal. The social game is regimental politics — rank, unit loyalty, combat record.

*Tone: military drama. Classic En Garde territory.*

The closest to traditional RPG territory. Combat matters more here than anywhere else. The duel grid is central to gameplay. But the social hierarchy of the military provides the En Garde structure — promotions, commissions, unit assignments, the favor of commanding officers.

#### The Exchange

A merchant hub where everything is transaction. Information, influence, loyalty — all commodities with fluctuating market value. Telepathy is technically illegal but universally assumed. An arms race of shielding and counter-shielding defines social interaction. Trust is the scarcest and most valuable resource.

*Tone: espionage thriller. Think Casablanca in space.*

Both SP and CP are valuable here. The social game is deal-making and the psi game is intelligence gathering. Every conversation is a negotiation and every negotiation assumes the other party might be reading your mind. Characters who can demonstrate trustworthiness — through null psi, through voluntarily lowering shields, through reputation — have an enormous advantage.

#### The Retreat

A pleasure world where the aristocracy vacations. Low stakes, high drama, abundant gossip. The perfect place to forge alliances away from official scrutiny. Also crawling with spies from every faction, all pretending to be on holiday.

*Tone: drawing room mystery. Agatha Christie at a galactic resort.*

A social pressure cooker. Everyone is relaxed, guards are down, and information flows freely — which means intelligence operatives are working overtime. The contrast between the setting's leisure and the covert activity beneath it creates natural tension. Empaths and Telepaths thrive here. Precogs receive visions triggered by the density of scheming minds.

#### The Ruins

A dead world with a skeleton crew of researchers studying ancient structures that interact with psionic energy in unpredictable ways. Small cast, isolated environment, high weirdness. The ruins amplify some powers and suppress others. Time behaves oddly in their vicinity.

*Tone: cosmic horror. Lovecraft meets Roadside Picnic.*

The temporal engine is most active here. Precog visions are more vivid, more frequent, and more disturbing near the ruins. Chronokinetic abilities awaken in characters who never had them. The boundary between past vision and future vision blurs. Retrocognition becomes unreliable — or is it precognition that's unreliable? The ruins don't care about your security posture. They care about something else, and no one has figured out what.

#### Temporal Variation

Different worlds can operate under different temporal rules, affecting how precognition functions:

- **Hard Determinism** (The Vigil, The Ruins) — the future is fixed. Visions show what *will* happen. The game is about positioning within an inevitable narrative. Suffering comes from attachment to alternative outcomes.
- **Soft Determinism** (The Court, The Exchange) — the shape is fixed, the details flex. You cannot stop the storm but you can choose who survives it. The most dramatically rich option.
- **Open Timeline** (The Frontier, The Flourish) — enough collective action genuinely rewrites the future. Visions are warnings, not prophecies. Empowering, but it means precogs must constantly reassess what they've seen.

A precog moving between worlds must recalibrate their entire relationship with their own power. "My visions were always right on The Vigil. Why are they failing me here?"

---

## V. What You Can Do

### The Temporal Engine

This is the innovation at the heart of WHEN. The thing that makes it unlike any other game.

The server maintains a **narrative timeline** — a planned sequence of events stretching out weeks, months, and potentially years into the real-world future. Political shifts, military conflicts, house intrigues, faction movements, catastrophes, revelations. Some events are global (affecting the entire Imperium), some planetary (affecting a single world), some local (affecting a faction, a house, or a handful of characters).

This timeline is not flavor text. It is not backstory delivered after the fact. It is a *living document* that the server uses to generate the game world's future — and that precognitive characters can *access*.

#### Precognition Is Real

When a precog character spends CP on a prophetic power, the server queries the narrative timeline. It selects an upcoming event relevant to the character's situation, filters it through the power's tier, and delivers a vision.

The vision is real. The event it describes is genuinely planned. The precog player receives actual foreknowledge of something that will happen in the game world.

This is not a simulation of precognition. It is not a random buff or a mechanical advantage dressed in narrative clothing. It is *precognition*. The fourth wall between mechanic and fiction dissolves. The character knows the future because the *player* knows the future.

#### The Five-Pillar Vision

Every vision describes a future state along the five pillars — but never all five, and never *when*:

- **Who** is acting? A face, a name, a silhouette, a house crest.
- **What do they have?** A weapon, a document, a key, a title.
- **What do they know?** A secret revealed, a lie exposed, an alliance discovered.
- **Where are they?** A room, a world, a landmark, a coordinate.
- **What are they doing?** An action frozen in time. A blade descending. A door opening. A signature on a document.

The power tier determines how many pillars are revealed and with what clarity:

- **Tier 1 — Sense Danger, Detect Psi**: One pillar, murky. A feeling. A location that radiates wrongness. A face half-seen. Enough to provoke unease. Not enough to act on.
- **Tier 2 — Augury, Pathfind**: Two pillars, somewhat clear. A person in a place. An action without an actor. A weapon without a wielder. Enough to start asking questions.
- **Tier 3 — Vision, Remote Viewing**: Three pillars, vivid. Who, where, and what they're doing. Or what they have, where, and what they know. Enough to form a plan — if you knew when.
- **Tier 4 — Prophecy** (master level, enormous CP cost): Four pillars, crystalline. Almost everything. The most dangerous amount of knowledge: so close to complete that the missing *when* feels like a wound. You know almost everything and can do almost nothing until the moment arrives.

**Five pillars are never revealed.** No power, no combination of powers, no expenditure of resources will ever tell you when. This is a cosmological constant. The universe has a fundamental information limit, and it is temporal.

#### The Weight of Knowing

Precognition carries a cost beyond CP expenditure.

**Burden** is a meter that accumulates with every vision received. It represents the psychological weight of carrying undated knowledge of the future. The more you know, the heavier it gets.

Burden affects gameplay:

- **Signal Degradation** — high Burden makes subsequent visions noisier, harder to interpret, more prone to ambiguity. The mind becomes saturated with unresolved futures.
- **Social Distortion** — high Burden characters become distant, distracted, cryptic in their social interactions. NPCs notice. Other players notice. Your social game suffers because you are carrying too much.
- **Crisis** — if Burden maxes out, the character enters a crisis state. Visions intrude unbidden. Past and future blur. Mechanical penalties across all activities until Burden is reduced.

Burden can be reduced:

- **Sharing** — telling someone what you've seen transfers some weight. But sharing a vision means giving away intelligence and potentially changing the outcome, rendering the knowledge you suffered for worthless.
- **Resolution** — when a foreseen event actually occurs, the Burden associated with that vision lifts. The relief is real but the event may be terrible.
- **The Ruins** — the ancient structures on the dead world interact with Burden in ways that aren't fully understood. Some characters report that time spent near the ruins reduces Burden. Others report that it transforms into something else.

The cruelest mechanic: Burden accumulates whether or not you *want* the visions. At high Precog tiers, visions arrive unbidden. The future presses in. You cannot un-know what you know, and you cannot stop knowing more.

This is the Cassandra engine. The game makes prophecy *feel* the way mythology always said it felt — not like a superpower, but like a curse that happens to be useful.

#### The Screaming

When the narrative timeline is under strain — when player actions are actively bending a major planned event away from its default trajectory — the server signals this to every precog in the affected area.

Not through a notification. Not through a UI indicator. Through *narrative intrusion*.

*Your dreams are fractured. Something you saw clearly has splintered. The edges of your vision vibrate with a sound that isn't sound. The future is resisting.*

The intensity scales with the magnitude of the timeline deformation:

- **Minor deviation**: Unease. A sense that something you foresaw has shifted slightly. Manageable.
- **Significant deviation**: Dissonance. Contradictory visions. Things you saw clearly are now uncertain. Burden spikes.
- **Major deviation**: Agony. The timeline is screaming. Every precog in range feels it. Visions become chaotic, overlapping, contradictory. The future is being rewritten and the rewriting *hurts*.

Non-precog players see their precog allies suddenly acting erratic. "What's wrong?" "The future is screaming." "What does that mean?" "I don't know yet."

This is emergent storytelling generated by server architecture. No designer scripted that conversation. The systems created the conditions for it.

#### The Struggle Against Destiny

The central dramatic question of WHEN: **can enough people knowing the future actually change it?**

The answer is: sometimes. And it depends on where you are.

Small events bend easily. A duel's outcome. A political appointment. An assassination attempt. Sufficient player intervention — warnings shared, alliances formed, actions taken — can genuinely divert the course of minor events. The vision becomes a warning that was heeded, and the future changes.

But major events — the wars, the upheavals, the catastrophes — are **attractors**. The narrative engine designates certain events as high-inertia nodes. They resist change. You prevent the assassination and the war starts anyway, for a different reason. You save House Venn and House Miran falls instead. The *shape* of the future is conserved even when the details shift.

This is not arbitrary cruelty. It is a philosophical position encoded in the game's architecture: **foreknowledge and fate exist in tension, and the outcome of that tension is the story**.

Players who push against destiny feel the resistance. Precogs feel the screaming. The timeline bends, strains, and sometimes — rarely, at great cost, with coordinated effort from many players — it *breaks*. A major event is averted. The future genuinely changes.

And every precog who saw the original future now carries visions of something that will never happen. Ghost futures. Burden that will never resolve through occurrence, because the event was unmade. The price of changing destiny is carrying the memory of the destiny you destroyed.

#### Retrocognition and the Temporal Blur

Retrocognition — seeing the past — follows the same five-pillar model. A retrocognitive vision shows a past state: who, what, where, what they knew, what they were doing. Vivid. Detailed. Real.

And without a timestamp.

A character with both Precognition and Retrocognition receives visions of events *without knowing whether they are past or future*. Did I see a murder that's going to happen, or one that already happened? Am I trying to prevent something or solve something?

At higher tiers, the emotional quality may differ — past visions feel more settled, future visions more volatile — but at lower tiers, the distinction blurs. A character could spend weeks trying to prevent something that already occurred. Or dismiss a prophetic vision as a historical echo.

Near the Ruins, the distinction collapses entirely. Past and future visions become indistinguishable. Time is not a line there. It is a field, and moving through it is like moving through fog.

#### The Information Economy

Precognitive visions are not just personal resources. They are *social currency*.

A player who has seen the future holds something of value. What they do with it defines their role in the social ecosystem:

- **Sell it** — trade intelligence to a faction for standing, resources, or protection
- **Share it** — warn allies, build trust, strengthen alliances
- **Weaponize it** — use foreknowledge to position yourself for personal advantage
- **Suppress it** — keep it secret, let events unfold, maintain your cover as a non-precog
- **Investigate it** — spend additional resources (CP, social connections, spy networks) to triangulate the *when* by watching for convergence of the revealed pillars
- **Challenge it** — attempt to change the foreseen outcome and discover whether this future bends or breaks

Each choice interacts with the reputation tracks, the faction system, the Burden mechanic, and the social dynamics of the player community.

The most powerful entity in the game is not a master precog. It is a master precog *embedded in a functioning intelligence network*. A precog alone has visions with no timestamps. A precog with informants, empaths, telepaths, and analysts can triangulate the when from real-world intelligence. Precognition plus human intelligence equals strategic omniscience — or the closest thing to it the game allows.

#### The Multiplayer Temporal Dynamic

In a multiplayer environment, precognition creates organic social structures that no designer needs to script:

- **Oracle networks** — precogs who share and compare visions, assembling composite pictures of the future from their individual fragments
- **Prophecy markets** — informal exchanges where visions are traded, verified, and valued based on the reputation of the seer
- **Temporal resistance cells** — groups dedicated to bending or breaking specific foreseen events, coordinating resources and actions across multiple players
- **Psi Inquisition targeting** — precogs are the most strategically dangerous type, and institutions will prioritize identifying and controlling them
- **Cassandra dynamics** — precogs who warn of disasters and aren't believed, watching helplessly as their visions unfold, gaining credibility only after the catastrophe they tried to prevent

None of these are designed game features. They are emergent consequences of making precognition real within a social system. The game provides the conditions. The players build the structures.

## Epilogue: When?

Five pillars describe the world completely. Identity, possession, knowledge, location, capability. Between them, they account for everything that can be known about a state of affairs.

But the future is not a state of affairs. It is a *process*. It moves. It approaches. It arrives at its own pace and on its own schedule, indifferent to the desires of those who have glimpsed it.

WHEN is a game about that indifference. About the human need to *know when* and the universe's refusal to answer. About the courage it takes to act on incomplete information, to carry the weight of partial knowledge, to struggle against a destiny that may or may not be mutable.

The social game gives players a world worth caring about — status, relationships, alliances, rivalries, reputation, identity. The psi powers give them the tools to navigate that world in ways that are extraordinary, dangerous, and costly. The temporal engine gives the world a *future* that is real, explorable, and contested.

And the missing pillar — the one that is never revealed, the one that defines the game's name and its soul — is the space where the player's own judgment, courage, and choice must fill the gap.

The future is coming. You can see its shape. You can feel its weight.

You just don't know when.
