# Cauchy Heat Map Visualizer

Interactive 2D heat maps generated entirely with Cauchy distributions. Click to move sources, tweak color schemes, and explore mathematical beauty.

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it.

## Features

- **Cauchy-driven**: Every value sampled from Cauchy distributions
- **Color schemes**: Monochromatic, analogous, triad, complementary, and more
- **Interactive**: Click the map to reposition sources
- **Seeded randomness**: Reproducible patterns via seed control
- **Adjustable density**: Scale the visualization resolution

## Color Theory

Port of Scala ColorWheel with 8 color scheme algorithms following established color theory principles.
