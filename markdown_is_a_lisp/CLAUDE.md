# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MarkdownIsALISP — a homoiconic programming language where Markdown IS the S-expression syntax. Markdown headings define functions, bullet lists form the AST, and backtick-wrapped values are literals. The interpreter runs in-browser with no build step.

## Development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser (or use any static file server). No build tools, no package manager, no tests.

## Architecture

- **`interpreter.js`** — The language itself: parser, evaluator, and runner. Exports `runMarkdownIsALISP(code, logFn)` and `nodeToMarkdown(node, indent)` as globals.
  - Parser: Markdown → AST (headings become DEF nodes, bullet nesting becomes tree structure via indent-tracking stack)
  - Evaluator: walks AST directly (no IR transformation) — `evaluate()` handles literals, symbols, special forms (`if`, `lambda`, `mial`, `eval`), and function application
  - Standard library: arithmetic, comparison, logic, cons/car/cdr, tag/children/make-mial, print/print-mial, parse-mial
  - `nodeToMarkdown`: renders AST back to Markdown (homoiconicity — code and data share the same Markdown form)
- **`index.js`** — UI controller: wires up editor, console output, AST panel, and example code snippets
- **`index.css`** — Styling (dark theme, split-pane layout)
- **`example_interpreter.ts`** — Earlier TypeScript/React prototype of the same interpreter (reference only, not used in production)

## Language Semantics

- `# name` defines a function or constant
- First child of a definition with 2+ children is the parameter spec; remaining children are the body
- Single-child definitions with a LITERAL child become constants; otherwise zero-arg functions
- Backtick-wrapped values (`` `42` ``, `` `"hello"` ``) are literals; bare words are symbols
- Indentation (2 spaces = 1 level) determines tree nesting
- Entry point is `# main`
- Special forms: `if`, `lambda`, `mial`, `eval`
- `mial` is MIAL's `quote` — returns its single child unevaluated (multi-child is an error). Backticks quote an atom; `mial` quotes a tree. `make-mial` constructs nodes (a string-literal tag denotes a symbol); `print-mial` renders a node to Markdown; `parse-mial` is its inverse

### Parser grammar (specified, not vibes)

- **Literals** are backtick-wrapped: `` `null` `` `` `true` `` `` `false` ``, `` `"..."` ``/`` `'...'` `` (quotes stripped), `` `` `` (empty string), and numbers. A number literal is recognized **only when it round-trips exactly** (`String(Number(v)) === v`), so `` `1.0` ``, `` `1e3` ``, `` `+5` ``, `` `0x10` `` deliberately stay strings to keep parse → render → parse stable. A backtick cannot appear inside a literal — there is no escape syntax.
- **Indentation** rounds down to the nearest 2-space level. A leading-whitespace count that isn't a multiple of 2 still parses, but emits a diagnostic — rounding is a defined, reported behavior, not a silent guess.
- **`parseMarkdown` returns `{ defs, diagnostics }`.** Nothing malformed is dropped silently: bullets before any `#` heading, non-heading/non-bullet lines, and unterminated backticks each produce a line-numbered diagnostic. `runMarkdownIsALISP` logs these as `Warning:` lines before execution.
- **Tokenizer is total** — no input hangs it; an unterminated backtick drops the stray char and is reported.

## Key Design Decisions

- All files use plain `<script>` tags (no ES modules, no bundler)
- `interpreter.js` must be loaded before `index.js` (globals: `runMarkdownIsALISP`, `nodeToMarkdown`, `NodeType`)
- AST nodes carry `type`, `value`, `children` (and transient `indent` during parsing)
- Values stay wrapped in LITERAL nodes through evaluation; `unwrap`/`wrap` handle the boundary between AST nodes and raw JS values
