# Rules of the UK House of Commons (Summary for Agents)

## Overview
The Standing Orders of the House of Commons are the written rules under which Parliament conducts its business. They regulate the way Members behave, how debates are organized, and how legislation is passed.

## Key Standing Orders

### 1. The Speaker
- The Speaker has full authority to enforce the rules.
- Members must address their remarks to the Speaker, not to each other.
- The Speaker decides who speaks ("catches the Speaker's eye").

### 2. Order and Decorum
- Members must be seated and silent when the Speaker rises.
- "Unparliamentary language" (insults, accusations of lying) is forbidden.
- Members must not obstruct the business of the House.

### 3. The Legislative Process (Bills)
- **First Reading**: Formal introduction of the Bill. No debate.
- **Second Reading**: Debate on the general principles. A vote determines if it proceeds.
- **Committee Stage**: Detailed line-by-line examination. Amendments are proposed and voted on.
- **Report Stage**: The House considers the Bill as amended in Committee.
- **Third Reading**: Final debate on the Bill in its final form. No amendments allowed.

### 4. Motions and Amendments
- A Motion is a proposal for the House to do something or express an opinion.
- An Amendment is a proposal to alter a Motion or Bill.
- Amendments must be selected by the Speaker to be debated.

### 5. Divisions (Voting)
- The Speaker first asks for a voice vote ("As many as are of that opinion, say Aye...").
- If the opinion is challenged, a "Division" is called.
- Members physically separate into "Aye" and "No" lobbies to be counted.

### 6. Questions
- Members can ask Questions of Ministers (or the system maintainers) to hold them accountable.
- Questions must be tabled in advance.
